### Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Aba

Hi, I'm [Aba](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abarajithan11/), an Electronics and Telecommunication graduate, currently working as a junior lecturer at (University of Moratuwa)[https://uom.lk/], Sri Lanka and a former research intern at [CSIRO, Australia](https://www.csiro.au/). Besides research, I enjoy teaching, food and backpacking.

**Personal facts:**

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a vision based traffic analytics startup, multi mode inference engine design (VLSI), and implementing Signed Karhunenâ€“LoÃ¨ve Transform (SKLT) on a ZYNQ PSoC
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ZYNQ microcontroller programming, Synopsys VLSI tools, Tensorflow 2.x
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ZYNQ
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about FPGAs, processor design, CNN inference
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Digital Designer, Backpacker, Foodie...

**Notable projects:**
- Undergraduate thesis project: [SoC Design for Vision Based Traffic Control](https://aba-projects.blogspot.com/2019/10/2019-vision-based-traffic-sensing-and.html) - Patent under review. Tensorflow 1.x, Keras, Python, C++, SystemVerilog, ZYNQ (private repo)
- Optimized Multi Mode Inference Engine for CNNs and Fully Connected Networks - Python, C++, SystemVerilog, ZYNQ, Synopsys DesignCompiler (private repo)
- Signed Karhunenâ€“LoÃ¨ve Transform on FPGA (private repo)
