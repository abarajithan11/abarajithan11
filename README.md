### Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm [Aba](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abarajithan11/)

I'm an Electronics graduate, currently working as a junior lecturer at [University of Moratuwa](https://uom.lk/), Sri Lanka and a former research intern at [CSIRO, Australia](https://www.csiro.au/). Besides research, I enjoy teaching, food and backpacking.

**Personal facts:**

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a vision based traffic analytics startup, multi mode inference engine design (VLSI), and implementing SKLT on a ZYNQ PSoC
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ZYNQ microcontroller programming, Synopsys VLSI tools, Tensorflow 2.x
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ZYNQ progamming
- ðŸ“« You can find me on: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/abarajithan11/)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about FPGAs, processor design, CNN inference
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: digital designer, backpacker, foodie...
