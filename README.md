### Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm [Aba](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abarajithan11/)

I'm an electronics graduate, currently working as a junior lecturer at [University of Moratuwa](https://uom.lk/), Sri Lanka and a former research intern at [CSIRO, Australia](https://www.csiro.au/). Besides research, I enjoy teaching, food and backpacking.

**Personal facts:**

- I recently conducted a free, open and independant hands-on webminar: __Digital Circuit Design, Simulation and Synthesis with SystemVerilog__. 
  - It was widely successful, over 170 attended from over 9 institutes in Sri Lanka, India and Sweden.
  - [Zoom recording](http://dms.uom.lk/s/wdRSTcFoHXkSTy7) was downloaded over 782 times in two days
  - Feedback about the [content, visuals](http://bit.ly/sv-slides) and teaching style was overwhelmingly positive. I'm so happy about this ðŸ˜„.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: 
  - Implementing SKLT on a ZYNQ PSoC
  - Vision based traffic analytics startup, 
  - Multi mode inference engine design (VLSI)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ZYNQ progamming
- ðŸ“« You can find me on: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/abarajithan11/)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about FPGAs, processor design, CNN inference
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: digital designer, backpacker, foodie...

**Projects:**

- Missing Semester
  - An initiative I have started at my department, to conduct hands-on webminars to familarize students with tools and languages.
