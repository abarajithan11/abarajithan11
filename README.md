### Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm [Aba](https://aba-blog.xyz/)

I'm a PhD student at University of California, San Diego, with about 4 years of experience building ML accelerators. Besides digital circuit design, I enjoy [teaching](https://aba-blog.xyz/tag/teaching/), [community work](https://aba-blog.xyz/tag/community/index.html) and [backpacking](https://aba-blog.xyz/tag/travels/index.html).

**Projects:**

- Missing Semester
  - An initiative I have started at my department, to conduct hands-on webminars to familarize students with tools and languages.
  - Free and open to anyone willing to learn
  - SystemVerilog webminar (above) was part of it.
