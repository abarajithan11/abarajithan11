### Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm [Aba](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abarajithan11/)

I'm an electronics graduate, currently working as an RTL Design Engineer at [Lemurian Labs](https://www.lemurianlabs.com), consultant at [University of Moratuwa](https://uom.lk/), Sri Lanka and I'm a former research intern at [CSIRO, Australia](https://www.csiro.au/). Besides digital circuit design, I enjoy teaching, food and backpacking.

**About Me:**

- Last November, I conducted a free, open and independant hands-on webminar: __Digital Circuit Design, Simulation and Synthesis with SystemVerilog__. 
  - It was widely successful, over 170 attended from over 9 institutes in Sri Lanka, India and Sweden.
  - [Zoom recording](http://dms.uom.lk/s/wdRSTcFoHXkSTy7) was downloaded over 1500 times.
  - [Feedback](https://bit.ly/sv-feedback) about the [content, visuals](http://bit.ly/sv-slides) and teaching style was overwhelmingly positive. I'm so happy about this ðŸ˜„.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: 
  - Kraken: a bufferless, efficient, multi-mode inference engine (VLSI)
  - Vision based traffic analytics startup
  - Accelerating modified YOLOv2 in Z7045, with 30 FPS (target) at 250 MHz
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with VLSI memory compilers
- ðŸ“« You can find me on: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/abarajithan11/)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about FPGAs, processor design, CNN inference
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: digital designer, backpacker, foodie...

**Projects:**

- Kraken: An optimized dataflow & accelerator for convolutions, fully-connected layers and matrix multiplications
  - Research paper (ongoing) - private repo
  - Python, C++, SystemVerilog, ZYNQ, Cadence Genus, ARM Artisan, LaTeX, Inkscape
- Missing Semester
  - An initiative I have started at my department, to conduct hands-on webminars to familarize students with tools and languages.
  - Free and open to anyone willing to learn
  - SystemVerilog webminar (above) was part of it.
- [SoC Design for Vision Based Traffic Control](https://aba-projects.blogspot.com/2019/10/2019-vision-based-traffic-sensing-and.html) 
  - Undergraduate thesis project
  - Patent under review - private repo 
  - Tensorflow 1.x, Keras, Python, C++, SystemVerilog, ZYNQ 
- Vision Based Traffic Analytics
  - Commercializing - private repo
  - Group work
  - Python, Tensorflow 2.x, AWS, Node.js
- [AbruTech Processor](https://aba-projects.blogspot.com/2018/01/2018-custom-processor-design-and.html)
  - My first big project in digital design
  - A custom processor on FPGA with our own architecture, ISA, assembler and simulator
  - Algorithms implemented: Downsampling, Upsampling RGB images, applying filters, prime finding with eratosthenes sieve
- Digital Graphic Equalizer
  - 3 bands, built for 5 extra marks
